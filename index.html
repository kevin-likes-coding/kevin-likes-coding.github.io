            <p>Engage Students in Fun New Ways

Educators have told us that using Minecraft to teach part of their curriculum has helped them improve student engagement, 
collaboration, creative exploration, and tangible learning outcomes.
<strong>Student Engagement</strong>
Minecraft Education Edition brings the classroom and curriculum to students in an environment they are already comfortable with. 
It offers the same Minecraft experience many students enjoy already, but with some additional capabilities that enable them to 
collaborate in the classroom, as well as support for educators to deliver learning activities within the game.</P>

            <p>How Much Does it Cost
We understand the demands on today√≠s educators and are committed to making Minecraft: Education Edition as affordable and accessible as possible. 
Minecraft:Education Edition costs $5 per user per year, and opportunities for volume licensing are also available by contacting your preferred reseller.</P>

<p>Programming in Minecraft
Using MinecraftEDU students can write real computer progams using the LUA language.  Right click on a computer to edit your code, or even better, 
use a real code editor outside of Minecraft to edit your code.</P>
